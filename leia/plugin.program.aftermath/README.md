Aftermath Wizard

Aftermath Wizard was created to help the Kodi community out and help get rid of the broken personal wizards that are floating around. As this is a work in progress, I would highly recommend the use of a repository, but if you prefer not to, there is a built-in auto-updater. The current version of the wizard is v0.2.5.

To get started, you can clone or fork this repository, and begin making your own changes.

There are a few things that need to be edited to fully customize your wizard:

* [addon.xml](https://github.com/drinfernoo/plugin.program.aftermath/wiki/addon.xml)
* icon.png - the icon to be shown in Kodi. This must be a 512x512 pixel '.png' file.
* fanart.jpg - the fanart to be shown in Kodi. This must be a 1920x1080 (or similar ratio) pixel '.jpg' file.
* [uservar.py](https://github.com/drinfernoo/plugin.program.aftermath/wiki/uservar.py)
* [Wizard Text Files](https://github.com/drinfernoo/plugin.program.aftermath/wiki/Wizard-Text-Files)

Once you've edited these files, you can zip the directory and install inside Kodi.
